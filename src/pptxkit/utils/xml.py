"""XML parsing for bytes that came from somewhere else.

A `.pptx` is a zip of XML, and `conform`, `qa`, `inspect` and `diff` all read one
the user was sent rather than one pptxkit wrote. `lxml`'s default parser expands
entities declared in an inline DTD, which is both an entity-amplification lever and,
on older libxml2, a local-file read.
