A conformance run writes under ``out/``, which is built to be deleted; adoption writes
the theme into the directory ``build`` resolves theme names from — beside the template
it binds to, which already lives there. Nothing is copied. The derivation is still the
first draft ``docs/conform.md`` says to edit.
