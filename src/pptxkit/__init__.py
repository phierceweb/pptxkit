"""Compile declarative deck specs into branded PowerPoint files.

The command line is the main surface (``docs/cli.md``); this module is the same
compiler as a Python call, for a caller generating specs rather than writing them::

    result = pptxkit.build_deck("deck.deck.yaml")

The spec wire format is ``docs/authoring.md``. There is no Python API for *composing*
a slide: a component the format cannot express is added by registering one
(``docs/extending.md``), not by calling into the layout engine.
