"""How a deck moves: what a click reveals, and how the show arrives at a slide.

python-pptx authors neither, so every module here appends the raw OOXML that
PowerPoint itself would emit.

**Nothing here is visible to the render loop.** LibreOffice draws only a slide's final
state, and silently repairs wrong child order and schema-invalid timing. Only real
PowerPoint confirms an animation is repair-free — see the verification table in
`docs/pptx-deck-building.md`.
