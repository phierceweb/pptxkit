"""Write a slide's ``<p:transition>`` — how the deck arrives *at* this slide.

**The transition belongs to the destination slide**: it says how the show moves *to*
this slide, not away from it. Reading it the other way puts every transition in a deck
one slide out.

Two hazards, both invisible to the render loop because LibreOffice repairs them
silently on import:

- ``CT_Slide`` is an ``xsd:sequence`` — ``transition`` precedes ``timing``, so a bare
  ``append`` after an animation lands it in the wrong place.
- Direction vocabularies are **per element**, not shared, so one generic direction list
  produces a file that is invalid the moment it meets ``strips``.
