# Errors — every message, beside its fix

A lookup doc. Arrive with the message in hand and search this page for the words in it.
Every message below is the real output of `bin/run build` on a real broken spec: the
compiler prints one line and exits `1`. (Long messages wrap in a terminal; they are
single lines.)

Nothing here explains the format — that is [`docs/authoring.md`](authoring.md), and the
per-component field tables are [`docs/components.md`](components.md). A finding on a deck
that *did* build comes from `pptxkit qa` instead: [`docs/qa.md`](qa.md).

## Old-format constructs

Every deleted construct fails with a message naming its replacement.

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: 'layout' is gone — a slide has no layout; put components under 'place:' and pick a backdrop with 'background:'` | Delete `layout:`. Add `background: inverse` if the slide was a `title`, `divider` or `close`; put its component in a `place:` entry. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: 'body' is gone — a component's name is its own key inside a 'place:' entry, e.g. place: [{at: {cols: [0, 12]}, bullets: {items: [...]}}]` | Delete the `body:` wrapper and put the component in a placement, keyed by its own name. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): 'type' is gone — a chart's type is now 'kind', e.g. kind: column-stacked` | Rename `type:` to `kind:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): 'categories' is gone — each category is a row in 'data', e.g. data: [{category: Q1, values: {Ads: 20, Organic: 15}}, ...]` | Replace the `categories` list with one `data:` row per category. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): 'series' is gone — series names are the keys of each row's 'values' mapping in 'data', e.g. data: [{category: Q1, values: {Ads: 20, Organic: 15}}, ...]` | Move each series' numbers into the `values:` mapping on the row they belong to. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): 'highlight' is gone as a top-level index — it's now per-row: set 'highlight: true' on the row you want highlighted` | Delete the index and put `highlight: true` on the row itself. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: 'reveal' is gone — use 'animate', e.g. animate: one_at_a_time instead of reveal: per-item` | Rename to `animate:` and use the new vocabulary. |

The old component names are gone too: `bullet-column` is `bullets`, `callout-list` is `callouts`, `stat-tiles` is `stats`, `doc-card` is `document`. So are the four layouts and every field only they read — `name:`, `tagline:`, `heading:`, `date:`, `part:`. A divider is now `background: inverse` with a `kicker:` and a `title:`.

## The deck document

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `bad.deck.yaml: deck config: missing required field 'theme'` | Add `theme: base` to the first document. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: no slides — a deck needs at least one slide document` | Add a `---` and a slide document after the deck document. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: no output path — set 'out:' in the deck config or pass --out` | Add `out: ../out/name/Name v1.pptx` — its own directory, because `render` and `qa` both write beside the deck and two decks sharing a directory overwrite each other's slides. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: deck config: 'sections' must be a list, got str` | Use YAML list syntax: `sections: [One, Two]`, not `sections: One, Two`. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: deck config: unknown field 'section'; did you mean 'sections'?` | The deck document's chapter list is plural. `section:` is a *slide* field. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: deck config: unknown field 'author'; known fields: theme, title, sections, extends, out` | The deck document takes exactly those five. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: invalid YAML — while scanning a quoted scalar …` | A quoting or indentation mistake. The message names the line and column. |
| `extension module not found: /path/to/my_components.py` | `extends:` is resolved beside the deck spec, and the message names the full path it tried. |
| `failed to import extension module my_components.py: body component 'card' is already registered` | The custom component's `@component("…")` name collides with one that ships. Rename yours. |

## The slide

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: unknown field 'subtile'; did you mean 'subtitle'?` | A typo. Take the suggestion. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: unknown field 'footer'; known fields: title, kicker, subtitle, notes, section, animate, transition, background, place, chrome` | A slide takes exactly those ten. Content goes in a placement. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: 'background' must name a colour pair ('page', 'inverse', 'accent-1', …) or be a mapping with 'image:', got ['dark']` | A background is one pair name or an image mapping, never a list. |
| `no colour pair 'dark'; declared pairs: accent-1, accent-2, accent-3, accent-4, inverse, page, page-muted, surface` | The name is not a pair this theme declares. The message lists the ones that are, which depends on how many accents the theme binds. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1 (component 'bullets'): item 2 is a dict, not a line of text — a bullet holding a comma or a colon needs quoting, or YAML reads it as a mapping` | `- One thing, then another` is a YAML *mapping*, not a string. Quote it: `- "One thing, then another"`. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1 placement 2 (card): [11.20, 3.00, 3.00, 1.00]in falls outside the canvas [0.00, 0.00, 13.33, 7.50]in` | A `box:` may leave the content band but not the slide. To run off an edge deliberately, add `bleed: true`. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: section 'Three' is not in the deck's sections (One, Two)` | Use a name from the deck's `sections:` list, or add it to that list. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: expected a mapping, got list` | A slide document must be a mapping. You probably left a `-` at the start of a line. |
| `slide 1: unknown animate 'per-item'; expected one of none, together, one_at_a_time, by_category, by_series` | Use one of the five listed values. |
| `slide 1: animate 'by_category' only applies to a native chart` | `by_category`/`by_series` need a `chart:`. Use `one_at_a_time` or `together` otherwise. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): a 'radar-filled' chart cannot build by category — its categories are vertices of one outline, not separate marks…` | A radar, scatter or bubble has no per-category mark to reveal. Use `animate: together`, or one of the kinds the message lists. |
| `this slide already carries an animation timeline, and a slide can hold only one…` | Two charts on one slide both asked to build. PowerPoint allows one timeline per slide; a second is an invalid file that LibreOffice converts without complaint. Give one chart a slide of its own, or drop the slide to `animate: together`. |
| `theme t.yaml: unknown motion key 'staggerms'; known keys: stagger_ms, advance, beat_ms, roles, transition` | A typo in the theme's `motion:` block. |
| `theme t.yaml: motion advance must be one of on_click, after_previous, got 'whenever'` | `advance:` takes those two. `after_previous` chains a build onto one click. |
| `theme t.yaml: motion beat_ms is -50; a pause between groups cannot be negative` | `beat_ms` is the gap between auto-advanced groups. |
| `theme t.yaml: unknown motion role 'squiggle'; known roles: datum, figure, line, surface, text` | Those five are the whole vocabulary. A component reports one; the theme binds it. |
| `theme t.yaml: motion role 'line' names unknown entrance 'explode'; known entrances: fade, wiperight, wipeup` | Three entrance kinds exist. Adding a fourth means adding a verified preset to the motion code, not to the theme. |
| `theme t.yaml: motion roles must be a mapping of role to kind, got ['line']` | `roles:` is a mapping — `roles: {line: {kind: wiperight}}`. |
| `theme t.yaml: motion transition must be a mapping with 'kind:', got 'fade'` | Write `transition: {kind: fade}`, not `transition: fade`. |
| `theme t.yaml: unknown transition key 'sped'; known keys: kind, dir, speed` | A typo inside `motion.transition`. |
| `theme t.yaml: transition speed must be one of slow, med, fast, got 'quick'` | The base schema has three speeds and no duration attribute. |
| `slide 1: component 'rule' reports motion role 'squiggle', which the theme does not bind; known roles: …` | A custom component returned a role outside the five. Return one of them, or a bare shape id. |
| `slide 1 (card): 'reveals: answer' names itself` | A placement cannot be its own trigger. |
| `slide 1 (card): 'reveals:' needs both placements to draw something that can be revealed, and one of them reported no shapes` | One end is a component that returns no reveal groups, so there is nothing to hide or to click. |
| `this slide already carries a transition` | Internal: two `add_transition` calls on one slide. A spec cannot cause this — a slide takes the theme's transition once. |
| `slide 1 (card): 'reveals: answer' names no placement on this slide; ids here: question` | `reveals:` names another placement's `id:` on the same slide. Give the trigger an `id:`. |
| `slide 1: 'reveals:' and 'animate: one_at_a_time' cannot share a slide…` | A slide carries one animation timeline. Interactive reveals and a click build are different kinds — drop one. |
| `slide 1: transition 'push' — a slide may only say 'none', for a deliberate hard cut…` | Which transition a deck uses is the theme's `motion.transition`. A slide may only refuse it. |
| `theme t.yaml: transition 'strips' has no direction 'l'; it accepts: lu, ru, ld, rd` | Each effect has its own direction vocabulary. `strips` takes corners only. |
| `theme t.yaml: transition 'fade' takes no direction, got 'l'` | Ten of the twenty-one effects take no `dir:` at all. |
| `theme t.yaml: unknown transition 'ripple'; known transitions: blinds, checker, …` | Only the 21 base-schema effects. The 2010-era extension set (ripple, glitter, morph…) is not written. |
| `theme t.yaml: motion stagger_ms is -40, which would schedule an item before the click that reveals it; use 0 or more` | A stagger is an offset after the click, so it cannot be negative. |

## A placement

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: 'place' must be a list, got dict` | `place:` is a list of placements — each entry starts with `- at:`. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: missing required field 'at'` | Every placement says where it goes. `at: {cols: [0, 12]}` is the full width. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: no component — a placement needs exactly one component key; known components: bullets, callouts, card, chart, code, connector, diverge, document, ellipse, fanout, flow, grid, icon, image, nav, panel, prose, rule, stats, swatches, table, versus` | Add one of those keys beside the `at:`. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: more than one component — found 'bullets' and 'stats'; give each its own placement` | Split them into two entries under `place:`. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: unknown field 'bulets'; did you mean 'bullets'?` | A typo. Take the suggestion. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: unknown field 'footer'; known fields: at, id, bleed, align, anchor, reveals, bullets, callouts, card, chart, code, connector, diverge, document, ellipse, fanout, flow, grid, icon, image, nav, panel, prose, rule, stats, swatches, table, versus` | A placement takes `at`, `id`, `bleed`, `align`, `anchor`, `reveals`, and one component key. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'align' must be one of left, center, right, got 'justify'` | Those are the three. `justify` is not offered. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'anchor' must be one of top, middle, bottom, got 'baseline'` | Those are the three. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: component 'bullets' must be a mapping, got str` | Components take a block. `bullets:` then `items:`, not `bullets: a`. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'at' needs 'cols' or 'box'` | `rows:` bounds a column span; it cannot stand alone. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'at.box' cannot be combined with 'cols' or 'rows'` | A `box:` is the escape hatch from the grid. Pick one or the other. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'at': cols is a name or a mapping, not a list — write {from: 6, to: 12}, or one of: full, left-half, …` | A span is a named fraction or `{from:, to:}`. A positional list is the form this replaced. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'at': cols 'left-quarter' names no fraction; one of: full, left-half, right-half, left-third, mid-third, right-third, left-two-thirds, right-two-thirds` | Quarters have no name — say `{from:, to:}`, or use the thirds and halves that do. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'at': cols from 6 must be less than to 6` | An empty span. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: split 1: a split child has no 'at' — the band gives it its rectangle` | Drop the child's `at:`; `split:` is what places it. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: a placement with 'split' takes only 'at' and 'split'` | A `split:` has no component of its own — its children carry them. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'split' divides a column band, so its 'at' takes 'cols' and 'rows', not 'box'` | Narrow the band with `cols:`, or place a `box:` on its own. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'at.cols' start 6 must be less than end 6` | The span is half-open, so the end is one past the last column. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'at': box is keyed, not a list — write {x: 0%, y: 0%, w: 100%, h: 100%}, in percents of the canvas` | A box names its four sides and states them in percents. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'at': box.x is a percent of the canvas, got 0.5 — write '50%' for half of it` | A bare number is refused rather than guessed at: `0.5` and `0.5in` look alike and only one is meant. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 2: duplicate id 'x'` | An `id:` names one rectangle on the slide. Rename one of them. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: placement 1: 'bleed' must be true or false, got 'yes'` | Unquoted `true`/`false`. YAML reads `'yes'` as a string. |

## The chrome block

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: unknown chrome field 'eyebrow'; known fields: kicker, title, subtitle` | Those are the three chrome fields. A fourth line is a placement, not chrome. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: 'chrome' sets 'subtitle' but the slide has no 'subtitle' text, so there is no line to place` | Give the slide the text, or drop the override. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: chrome field 'title': box {…} leaves the canvas — a chrome box is percents of the canvas, never inches` | Divide the inches by the canvas size and write a percent. `11.3in` of `13.333in` is `84.7%`. |
| `chrome field 'title' wraps to 1.12in but its box is only 0.60in tall — it would be drawn through the line below; deepen the box, shorten the text, or drop to a smaller rung` | Deepen the box, shorten the text, or drop to a smaller rung; the estimate is the same wrap measure the stacked chrome uses. |
| `bad.deck.yaml: slide 1: chrome field 'title': align must be one of left, center, right, got 'justify'` | Those are the three. |
| `chrome field 'title' sets anchor 'bottom' but no 'at:' — a stacked line shares the stack's frame, so it has no frame of its own to anchor in; give it an 'at:'` | Add an `at:` to the same field. |
| `theme 'base' has no type role 'headline'; known roles: body, caption, display, head, hero, kicker, lead, stat, subtitle, title` | A chrome `rung:` names a rung of the theme's ramp. |
| `no colour pair 'accent-9'; declared pairs: accent-1, accent-2, …` | A chrome `pair:` names a declared palette pair. |

## Placement geometry

Shape errors above come from the parser, before any inch exists. These come from the placement engine, once `at:` has been resolved against the theme's grid.

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `slide 1 placement 1 (bullets) overlaps slide 1 placement 2 (stats)` | Two placements claim the same space. Make the spans disjoint — `cols: [0, 6]` and `cols: [6, 12]`, not `[0, 7]` and `[6, 12]`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'panel'): align 'center' has nothing to act on — 'panel' sets no text of its own; drop the align` | `align`/`anchor` set type. `panel`, `chart`, `connector` and `document` draw no type of their own. |
| `slide 1 (component 'callouts'): align 'center' would pull each row's text away from its dot; 'callouts' sets text flush to the dot rail` | Drop the `align`. `anchor` still works. |
| `slide 1 placement 1 (bullets): [0.00, 0.00, 6.67, 3.75]in falls outside the content area [0.73, 1.65, 11.87, 5.40]in` | A `box:` that leaves the content band. Move it inside, or add `bleed: true` if running off the edge is the point. |
| `slide 1 placement 1 (bullets): overlaps the reserved region 'logo-wedge'` | A `box:` landing on a region the theme keeps for the brand. Move it, or switch to `cols:`/`rows:`, which the compiler narrows for you. |
| `slide 1 placement 1 (bullets): cols [0, 13] out of range — a span runs 0..12 with start < end` | The end is one past the last column, so 12 is the maximum. |
| `slide 1 placement 1 (bullets): rows [6, 13] out of range — the content band has 12 rows and a span runs 0..12 with start < end` | Rows are 12 divisions of the content band, indexed the same half-open way. |

## The chart block

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): unknown field 'legend'; known fields: kind, data, unit, annotate, y_min, y_max` | Delete it. The chart block takes exactly those six. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): 'kind' must be one of bar, column, column-stacked, … got 'donut'` | Use a name from [the 29](authoring.md#all-29-chart-kinds). It is `doughnut`, not `donut`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): 'data' must be a non-empty list of rows` | Add `data:` with at least one row. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 needs a 'category'` | Every category row needs its own label. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 2 (category 'Q2') needs a 'value' or 'values'` | Give the row a number. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 (category 'Q1') carries both 'value' and 'values' — use one` | Pick one. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 2 (category 'Q2') uses 'values' but row 1 (category 'Q1') uses 'value' — use one or the other for the whole chart` | Convert every row to the same form. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 2 (category 'Q2') is missing series 'Organic' (present in row 1 (category 'Q1'))` | Every row must carry every series. Add it, with `0` if that is the truth. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 2 (category 'Q2') has series 'Referral', which no other row defines; known series: Ads` | Either a typo, or a series the first row is missing. The first row defines the set. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 has unknown field 'color'; known fields: category, values, value, highlight` | Colour is the theme's business. Delete it. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 (category 'Q1') has a non-numeric 'value': 'twelve'` | Use a number, unquoted. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 (category 'Q1') series 'Ads' has a non-numeric value: 'high'` | Same, inside a `values:` mapping. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 (category 'Q1') 'values' must be a non-empty mapping of series name to number, got {}` | Fill in the mapping, or use `value:` for a single series. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 (category 'Q1') 'highlight' must be true or false, got 3` | `highlight` is a flag on the row, not an index. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): only one row may set 'highlight: true' — row 1 (category 'Q1') and row 2 (category 'Q2') both do` | Highlight one datapoint. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 carries 'x'/'y' but chart kind 'column' is category-shaped; use 'category' and 'values'` | Either switch the rows to `category`, or switch the kind to an `xy-scatter*` one. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 carries 'category' but chart kind 'xy-scatter' takes 'x'/'y', not 'category'` | The mirror image of the above. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 needs a 'y'` | Both `x` and `y` are required on every xy and bubble row. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 needs 'size' for chart kind 'bubble'` | Bubble rows need a third number. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): row 1 has a non-positive bubble size: 0.0` | A bubble of zero area cannot be drawn. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): 'annotate' is missing 'detail'` | `annotate` needs all three of `at`, `title`, `detail` — or leave it out, since nothing draws it. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): 'annotate' index 4 is out of range for 1 categories` | `at` is a 0-based index into `data`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): 'y_min' must be a number, got 'zero'` | Use a number. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): must be a mapping, got str` | `chart:` takes a block, not a bare value. You wrote `chart: column` instead of `chart:` then `kind: column`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'chart'): chart kind 'line' cannot show 'highlight' — its data points have no fill of their own. Kinds that can: …` | The only `highlight` error whose fix is the *kind*, not the row. Switch to a bar/column, pie/doughnut or bubble kind, or drop `highlight:` and make the point with the title or `animate:`. The kinds that take one are listed under [the chart block](authoring.md#the-chart-block). |
| `theme 'brand' declares 1 accent role(s); 'highlight' marks a point with the second accent, so a palette with fewer cannot show one` | Internal: a `bind:` layers over the built-in roles, which always carry four accents, so no theme file can reach this. It guards a palette assembled in code. |

## Components

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `slide 1 (component 'bullets'): unknown field 'colums'; known fields: items, columns, heading` | Every component refuses a key it does not read, naming the ones it does. A misspelled field is never accepted in silence. |
| `slide 1 (component 'bullets'): 'items' must be a non-empty list` | Add `items:` with at least one entry. Also what you get for a misspelled `items`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'bullets'): must be a mapping, got list` | Components take a block. `bullets:` then `items:`, not `bullets: [a, b]`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'callouts'): item 1 needs a 'head'` | Every callout item needs `head:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'flow'): step 2 needs a 'head'` | Every flow step needs `head:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'flow'): step 1 has the unknown field 'title'; a step reads: body, head, icon` | A step carries those three keys and nothing else. |
| `slide 1 (component 'flow'): a flow needs at least 2 steps to be a sequence — a single step is the 'card' component` | Add a step, or use `card`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'flow'): 'current' is the 1-based step to highlight, so it runs 1 to 4 for these items; got 5` | Count from 1, not 0. |
| `slide 1 (component 'stats'): item 1 needs a 'value'` | Every stat tile needs `value:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'stats'): item 1 has the unknown field 'and the critical path'; an item reads: icon, label, value — a key that reads like prose is an unquoted comma; quote the value` | YAML read `label: of a run, and the critical path` as *two* keys, so the label is truncated as well. Quote it. Every unknown-field message says this when the key holds a space, which is the only way one can. |
| `slide 1 (component 'callouts'): item 1 has the unknown field 'note'; an item reads: body, head, icon` | A callout row carries those three. Same unquoted-comma trap as above. |
| `slide 1 (component 'card'): a card needs a 'heading', a 'body' or an 'icon' — an empty plate is the 'panel' component` | Give it one of the three, or use `panel`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'card'): 'radius' is a fraction of the plate's short side, 0..0.5 (0.5 is a stadium); got 0.75` | Radius is a fraction, not inches. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): row 2 cell 1 has no key 'bold'; a cell reads: text, across, down, align, valign, emphasis, pair` | Bold is `emphasis: true`. The cell-key table in [`components.md`](components.md) says what each of the seven does. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): row 2 is a list, not a cell — a row holding a comma needs quoting, or YAML reads it as one` | An unquoted comma inside a cell made YAML read the cell as a list. Quote that cell. |
| `slide 1 (component 'bullets'): field 'columns' must be an int, got 'two'` | Use a number. |
| `slide 1 (component 'document'): 'source' is required` | Point at a markdown file. |
| `slide 1 (component 'document'): source not found: examples/nope.md — looked beside the deck spec and in /path/you/ran/from` | Looked for beside the deck spec first, then as given. The message names both places. |
| `slide 1 (component 'document'): 'side' must be one of left, right, full, got 'middle'` | Use one of the three. |
| `slide 1 (component 'document'): 'lines' must look like '12-40' — one-based and inclusive, got '12'` | A range needs both ends. Write `lines: '12-40'`; quote it so YAML keeps it a string. |
| `slide 1 (component 'document'): 'lines' must start at 1 or more and end at or after its start, got '5-2'` | Lines are numbered from 1, and the range reads low to high. |
| `slide 1 (component 'document'): 'lines' starts at 11 but docs/qa.md has only 10 line(s) — the excerpt is gone from the source, so the card would be empty` | The source shrank past the range. Re-read the file and pick the lines you meant — this is the drift `lines:` exists to surface rather than card an empty box. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): 'rows' must be a non-empty list` | Add `rows:` with at least one row. Also what you get for a misspelled `rows`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): row 1 covers 2 column(s) but the table is 3 wide — a table is rectangular, so add a cell, or widen one with 'across:'` | Give the row its missing cell. The count includes any column a `down:` cell above already covers. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): row 2 covers 3 column(s) but the table is 2 wide — a table is rectangular, so this row has a cell too many — a column a 'down:' cell above already covers is not written again` | Delete the cell that stands under the reaching one. If *every* column is covered, the table wants one row fewer. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): the first row fixes the table's width, so it cannot be the empty row that a 'down:' cell above leaves behind — give the table a 'header:', or start it with real cells` | An empty first row leaves the table no columns to be. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): row 2 has no cells of its own — every one of its columns is covered by a 'down:' cell above, so the row is height and nothing else. Drop it, and drop a row from the 'down:' that reached into it: the table you meant is the same table without either` | Shorten the `down:` by one and delete the row. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): row 1 cell 1 sets 'down' to 4, reaching past the last of the table's 2 row(s) — count the header and total rows, which are rows of the table too` | A `down:` counts rows of the built table, not entries in `rows:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): row 2 cell 1 reaches across a column that a 'down:' cell above already covers — cells cannot overlap` | The row's `across:` walks into a column the row above claimed. Split the span, or move the `down:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): row 1 cell 1 sets 'down' to 0 — it is how many rows the cell covers, itself included, so it is a whole number from 1` | A cell covering only itself is `1`, not `0`. Same message for `across:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): 'align' is one entry per column, so it needs 3; got ['left', 'right']` | `align:` is per column, not one value for the table. `valign:` is the opposite — one value for the whole table. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): 'valign' is one of top, middle, bottom, got 'centre'` | Those are the three. A cell's own `valign` takes the same three. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): 'rules' is one of rows, header, grid, none, got 'dotted'` | Those are the four. Rule weight and colour are `weight:` and `color:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): 'density' scales the cell padding, so it is a positive number — 0.6 for a dense table, 1.4 for an airy one; got 0` | `density:` is a multiplier, never inches. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): 'widths' entries must be positive numbers, got 0` | Widths are relative weights; a column of zero has no room for its own padding. |
| `slide 1 (component 'fanout'): 'source' is the call the branches leave from` | Add `source:` — the call the plate carries. |
| `slide 1 (component 'fanout'): a fanout needs at least 2 items — one consequence is the 'connector' component` | Add a consequence, or draw the single link with `connector`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'fanout'): item 1 needs a 'text'` | Every branch says what it sets off; the `icon:` is optional. |
| `slide 1 (component 'fanout'): item 1 has the unknown field 'colour'; an item reads: icon, text` | A branch carries those two. |
| `slide 1 (component 'prose'): 'paragraphs' is a non-empty list of strings, one per paragraph` | Give it a YAML list. A single string is one paragraph in a one-item list. |
| `slide 1 (component 'prose'): 3 paragraph(s) need 6.10in at this measure but the body rect is only 5.30in — split the slide or shorten the copy` | The measure is capped for readability, so more copy means more depth, not a wider line. |
| `slide 1 (component 'fanout'): 'weight' scales the bus stroke, 0.5 to 4.0; got 99` | It is a multiple of the default stroke, not a point size. |
| `slide 1 (component 'fanout'): the source plate and the bus leave 0.62in for the consequences — widen the placement` | The placement is too narrow to carry both halves. |
| `slide 1 (component 'versus'): anchor 'middle' has nothing to act on — a versus fills its placement and sets its own type; drop the anchor, or bound the placement with 'rows:'` | It stretches to whatever rectangle it is given, so drop the anchor or bound the placement with `rows:`. Same message for `align`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'versus'): 'left' needs a 'value' and a 'label' — a versus is two named magnitudes` | Each side names itself and carries a number. |
| `slide 1 (component 'versus'): 'left' has the unknown field 'colour'; a side reads: highlight, label, note, value` | A side carries those four. Colour comes from `highlight:` and the theme. |
| `slide 1 (component 'versus'): both sides set 'highlight' — it marks the one the slide is arguing for, so only one side takes it` | Drop one. Marking both says nothing. |
| `slide 1 (component 'versus'): each side gets 0.98in across — widen the placement` | Two plates and the glyph between them need the room. |
| `slide 1 (component 'diverge'): 'items' must be a non-empty list` | Add `items:` with at least one row. Also what you get for a misspelled `items`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'diverge'): item 1 needs a 'label' and a 'value'` | Every row names itself and carries the signed number its bar draws. |
| `slide 1 (component 'diverge'): item 1 has value 'lots' — a value is the signed number the bar draws` | A value is a number. The sign is what decides which side of the rule it draws on. |
| `slide 1 (component 'diverge'): item 1 has the unknown field 'colour'; an item reads: label, note, value` | A row carries those three. Colour comes from the sign and the theme's accents, never from the spec. |
| `slide 1 (component 'diverge'): 'peak' is a positive magnitude; got 0` | `peak:` is what the longest bar stands for, so it is greater than zero. |
| `slide 1 (component 'diverge'): 'label_width' is a fraction of the placement's width, 0.1 to 0.6; got 3` | It is a fraction, not inches or a column count. |
| `slide 1 (component 'diverge'): align 'center' would pull the labels off the centre rule they are set against; 'diverge' sets each label flush to the rule` | Drop the `align`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'nav'): 'items' must be a non-empty list of section names` | Add `items:` with at least one section name. Also what you get for a misspelled `items`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'nav'): active 'Evidenec' is not one of the items (Problem, Evidence, Next)` | `active:` names one of `items:` exactly. Refused rather than ignored: a renamed section would silently mark nothing. |
| `slide 1 (component 'nav'): color 'line' is EDEDED against this slide's FFFFFF, 1.17:1 — a label that close to the paper cannot be seen; name a role that stands off it` | A role you name is honoured however low its contrast, but not when it is invisible. Name an accent or `ink`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'image'): 'src' must name an image file` | Add `src:`. Also what you get for a misspelled `src`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'image'): a circle mask needs 'fit: cover'. 'contain' letterboxes the picture down to the source's own aspect, and the mask drawn on that oblong is an oval, not a circle — crop it with 'crop: 1:1' instead` | Drop the `fit: contain`, or use `mask: rounded`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'image'): mask must be one of none, circle, rounded, got 'hexagon'` | Use one of the three. |
| `slide 1 (component 'image'): 'radius' is a fraction of the picture's short side, 0..0.5 (0.5 is a circle); got 0.75` | Radius is a fraction, not inches. |
| `slide 1 (component 'image'): 'widescreen' is not an aspect — write it as '16:9' or 1.78` | `crop:` takes an aspect. Quote it: `crop: "16:9"`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'image'): every 'over' line needs a 'text', got {'rung': 'title'}` | Each `over:` entry is a string or a mapping containing `text:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'image'): an inset of 0.9 leaves the text no width inside a picture 11.87in wide` | `inset:` is a fraction of canvas width, and it is applied to both edges. |
| `slide 1 (component 'image'): scrim has no key 'colour'; known keys: pair, opacity, gradient` | A scrim's colour comes from its `pair:`, never a literal. |
| `slide 1 (component 'image'): a 'bottom' gradient scrim cannot make this legible — the text reaches far enough into the clear end that it would need 486% peak opacity; move the text toward the bottom edge or use a flat scrim` | The text sits in the gradient's clear end. `anchor: bottom` the placement, or drop `gradient:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'ellipse'): the label 'Discovery phase' needs more than the 0.48in across the middle of a 0.68in disc at 12.0pt — grow the placement, raise 'size', or name a smaller 'rung'` | A label is refused rather than clipped, and it is measured across the *inscribed* width, not the diameter. Widen the placement, raise `size:`, or name a smaller `rung:`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'connector'): 'from' is required — give it a placement id, or two numbers, x then y, as fractions of the canvas` | Both ends are required. Same message for a missing `to:`, and for either one misspelled. In the spec the pair is a list: `from: [0.5, 0.5]`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'connector'): 'to' names the placement id 'summary', which this slide does not declare; ids here: discover` | The end names an `id:` that no placement **on this slide** carries. The message lists the ids that exist; a connector cannot reach onto another slide. |
| `slide 1 (component 'connector'): 'from' must be a placement id, or two numbers, x then y, as fractions of the canvas; got [0.5]` | An end given as a list must hold exactly two numbers, each a fraction of the canvas. A bare string is read as a placement id instead. |
| `slide 1 (component 'connector'): 'from' and 'to' resolve to the same point on the canvas, so the line has no direction` | The two ends are the same placement, or two identical `[x, y]` pairs. A line needs somewhere to go. |
| `slide 1 (component 'icon'): needs a 'name:' saying which glyph to draw — one of 4,001 names, catalogued in docs/glyphs.md` | Add `name:`. Also what you get for a misspelled `name`. The catalogue is [`docs/glyphs.md`](glyphs.md). |
| `slide 1 (component 'rule'): align 'center' has nothing to act on — a horizontal rule spans its placement's whole width; use anchor to move it across, or narrow the placement` | A rule already fills one axis, so the key that would move it *along* that axis does nothing. Use the other key — `anchor:` for a horizontal rule, `align:` for a vertical one — or narrow the placement. |

## Themes written before the cutover

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `type ramp entry 'title': 'rung' (points per inch of canvas height) was replaced by 'pt' — the size at the theme's reference_height` | State the point size: `title: {pt: 34}`, with `type.reference_height:` naming the canvas it is for (7.5in by default). |
| `type ramp entry 'title': 'size' (point size) was replaced by 'pt' — the size at the theme's reference_height` | Same key, new name. |

| `slide 1 (component 'code'): needs 'lines' (a list) or 'text' (a block scalar) — a listing with nothing in it draws an empty plate` | Give it one of the two. |
| `slide 1 (component 'code'): give 'lines' or 'text', not both — 'text' is a block scalar, 'lines' a list` | Pick one. `text:` is for pasting a listing whole; `lines:` for building it up. |
| `slide 1 (component 'code'): 6 lines need 3.10in but only 2.40in is left — shorten the listing, split the slide, or lower 'size'` | A listing is as deep as its line count at its point size. Do one of the three. |
| `slide 1 (component 'code'): 'size' is a point size, got 'small'` | `size:` is a number of points, not a name. |
| `slide 1 (component 'code'): 'size' 8.0pt is below the theme's 10.5pt minimum` | The theme sets the floor; raise the size or lower `type.min_pt` in the theme. |
| `slide 1 (component 'swatches'): 14 roles in 8 columns need 3.40in but the body rect is only 2.60in — show fewer roles or split the slide` | Name a subset in `roles:`, or give the placement more rows. |
| `slide 1 (component 'swatches'): 'roles' is a list of palette role names; omit it to show every role the theme declares` | Either give a list, or drop the key. |
| `slide 1 (component 'swatches'): no palette role(s) brand-blue; declared roles: accent-1, accent-2, …` | Roles are the theme's semantic names, not brand words. The message lists the ones that exist. |
| `slide 1 (component 'grid'): the placement is 0.40in tall, too short to draw a grid in` | Give it more rows — a grid needs depth to read as one. |
| `slide 1 (component 'callouts'): a 'heading' needs 0.42in and the placement is only 0.30in tall` | Drop the heading, or give the placement more rows. |

## Images, themes and templates

A slide's `background: {image:}`, an `image` or `card` component's `src:`, and a theme's
`marks.media:` all resolve the same way, so they all fail the same way. The not-found
messages name every directory they searched, because "not found" alone cannot tell you
whether your path or your theme is at fault.

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `image 'cover.jpg' does not exist` | An absolute name is taken exactly as written and nothing is searched. Check the path. |
| `image 'cover.jpg' was not found in authoring/q4, and the theme names no template to fall back on — put the file beside the deck spec, or give the theme a 'template:' that carries it` | A themeless theme has no archive to fall back into, so the deck's own directory was the only place to look. |
| `image 'cover.jpg' was not found in authoring/q4, nor inside brand.pptx at ppt/media/cover.jpg` | Every place was searched and named. Either the file is somewhere else, or the name it carries inside the template's archive is not the one you wrote. |
| `image '../shared/cover.jpg' climbs out of every directory it would be looked for in — name it relative to the deck spec or the theme's template, or give the full path` | A `..` leaves every search directory, so no search order can apply to it. Move the file beside the spec, or write the absolute path. |
| `unknown theme 'acme': no theme file at templates/acme.theme.yaml (set PPTXKIT_THEME_DIR to search elsewhere) and no packaged theme of that name (packaged: base). Onboard a brand template with 'pptxkit conform <brand>.pptx --adopt acme', or pass a path to a theme file` | The deck's `theme:` (or `--theme`) is a name, and neither the theme directory nor the package holds it. Onboard the brand template with `pptxkit conform templates/Brand.pptx --adopt acme`, point `PPTXKIT_THEME_DIR` at wherever your themes live, or use `theme: base`. |
| `theme file not found: templates/acme.theme.yaml — that is read as a path, and nothing is searched. To load a theme by name, pass the bare name (e.g. 'base'), which is looked up in templates and then in the packaged themes` | Anything with a suffix or a directory in it is a path, taken exactly as written. Fix the path, or drop to the bare name so the theme directory and the packaged themes are searched. |
| `template brand.pptx is not a readable .pptx: PackageNotFoundError: Package not found at 'brand.pptx'` | The theme's `template:` is corrupt, truncated, or another application's format under a `.pptx` name. The message names the path and what python-pptx made of it. |
| `deck Deck v3.pptx is not a readable .pptx: PackageNotFoundError: Package not found at 'Deck v3.pptx'` | The same refusal from `inspect`, about the deck you handed it rather than a template. `qa` reports an unreadable deck as a `package` finding instead. |

## Too much content

These fire at build time with the real measurements, so the number in the message is the number to fix.

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `slide 1 (component 'bullets'): 30 bullets in the longest column need 10.08in but only 5.30in is available — split the slide, add a column, or shorten the list` | Do one of the three things it suggests. |
| `slide 1 (component 'callouts'): 6 items need 13.35in of height but the body rect is only 5.40in — split the slide or shorten the copy` | Rows are as deep as their own copy, so the ceiling is the total depth of the words, not a fixed item count. Cut a row, or cut the wordiest body. |
| `slide 1 (component 'stats'): 5 items in 1 columns need 8.22in of height but the body rect is only 5.30in — split the slide or reduce the items` | Raise `columns:` (up to 4) or drop a tile. |
| `slide 1 (component 'flow'): 6 steps and the 0.36in lanes between them need more than the 2.00in this placement runs across — drop a step or grow the placement` | Widen the `at:`, or switch to `direction: vertical`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'flow'): a numbered disc is 0.60in across at this canvas's head size, and each step is only 3.79x0.50in — grow the placement or drop 'numbered'` | Give the flow more rows, or set `numbered: false`. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): 41 rows need 17.30in of height but the placement is only 5.30in — split the table or shorten the cells` | Split the table across slides, or cut rows. |
| `slide 1 (component 'table'): 60 columns leave 0.20in each, less than the 0.36in the theme's gutter pads a cell by — drop a column, widen the placement, or tighten it with 'density:'` | Six or seven columns is the practical ceiling on a 12-column placement at the default density; `density: 0.6` buys a couple more. |
| `slide 1 (component 'document'): the card came out 14.92in tall but only 5.30in is available — card fewer lines with 'lines: 12-40', raise 'max_width' to set the type smaller, or use 'side: left'/'side: right' to narrow it. Do not copy part of the file into a shorter one; the copy is what this component exists to avoid` | The markdown file is too long for one slide. Narrow it with `lines:` — copying an excerpt into a second file is the drift this component exists to prevent. |
| `slide 1 (component 'card'): the card's type wants 4.59in but only 0.05in is left inside the plate — shorten the copy or grow the placement` | A card is a plate with an inset, so the type gets less room than the placement suggests. Cut the `body:`, or give it more rows. |
| `slide 1 (component 'card'): the icon alone wants 1.20in of the 0.90in inside the plate — grow the placement or drop the icon` | The glyph is sized off the `head` rung, so a short placement cannot hold one. |
| `slide 1 (component 'card'): the placement is smaller than the 0.18in the theme's gutter insets a card by on every side` | The placement is smaller than the plate's own padding. Widen the `at:`. |
| `content is 8375px tall but the render canvas is only 4000px — the browser clipped it; raise PPTXKIT_SHOT_CANVAS_H to at least 8375 or shorten the source` | A far longer `document:` source — the browser clipped it before the card guard above could measure it. Shorten the file. |
| `the height probe did not run and the content reaches the last row of the 4000px render canvas, so the browser clipped it — raise PPTXKIT_SHOT_CANVAS_H or shorten the source` | The same clip, caught in the pixels because the source swallowed the height probe: a raw `<plaintext>`, `<textarea>` or `<xmp>`, or an unterminated `<script>`, ends the parse before the appended script. Fix the stray tag, or raise the canvas. |

The last two are the only messages here that arrive with a Python traceback above them: a browser that clipped the page is an external-renderer failure, not a spec mistake, so they are logged as errors rather than reported as validation messages. Every other message on this page is a single clean line and an exit code of `1`.

## External tools

Four commands shell out — LibreOffice, Poppler's `pdftoppm` and `pdftotext`, and a
Chromium-family browser. Each failure names the binary it could not use, so the fix is
always "install that one, or point the matching `PPTXKIT_*` variable at it"; which
command needs which tool is in [`docs/cli.md`](cli.md#external-tools).

A tool that is **absent** and a tool that **ran and failed** are different errors. The
first is about the machine and prints as one line; the second is a renderer fault and is
logged with a traceback, because there is a crash to report.

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `soffice not found (/path/to/soffice) — needed by render, and QA's render-based checks; brew install --cask libreoffice, or set PPTXKIT_SOFFICE to the path of an installed one` | LibreOffice is not installed, or `PPTXKIT_SOFFICE` names something that is not there. The message carries the install command for this platform. |
| `pdftoppm not found (/path/to/pdftoppm) — needed by render, and QA's render-based checks; brew install poppler, or set PPTXKIT_PDFTOPPM to the path of an installed one` | Poppler is not installed, or `PPTXKIT_PDFTOPPM` names something that is not there. |
| `no Chrome/Chromium binary found — needed by shot and any 'document:' slide; brew install --cask google-chrome, or set PPTXKIT_CHROME to the path of an installed one` | Only `shot` and a `document:` component need a browser; everything else builds without one. |
| `could not start the browser at '/path/to/chrome' — brew install --cask google-chrome, or set PPTXKIT_CHROME to the path of an installed one` | `PPTXKIT_CHROME` (or a `chrome=` argument) names something that is not there, or is not executable. Correct the path, or unset the variable to fall back to autodetection. |
| `<any of the above>` + `Or re-run with --no-render for the checks that need no external tool: bounds, placement, reserved regions, type sizes and contrast.` | `qa` adds this line to any missing-tool failure. `--no-render` runs every manifest-based check and skips only overflow and render contrast. |
| `LibreOffice PDF conversion failed` | `soffice` ran and exited non-zero — installing it is no fix. The deck, or the profile directory, is what it refused; the log record carries both. |

A missing tool is a configuration failure, not a validation one: the CLI prints the
message alone and exits 1, since the fix is on the machine and not in the stack. In a
`conform` run either kind fails the one exercise that needed the tool and the run
continues.

## The glyph bundle

The ~4,000 Material Symbols `icon:` draws from ship as one archive with a manifest
pinning it. These fire when that pair is missing or disagrees — see
[`docs/cli.md`](cli.md#glyphs--the-built-in-icon-set).

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `no icon 'rocket_launch': the built-in glyph bundle is missing from …/glyphs.zip — run 'bin/setup', or 'pptxkit glyphs sync' to rebuild it` | The archive is absent, so *every* name misses. This is an install problem, not a typo, which is why no near-miss is offered. |
| `the glyph bundle …/glyphs.zip is gone` | It disappeared between being opened and being read — a rebuild or a `git clean` mid-run. Re-run the command. |
| `no glyph manifest at …/glyphs.sum — the checkout is incomplete` | `glyphs.sum` is committed beside the archive; restore it (`git checkout` it) rather than regenerating, or the pin is lost. |
| `glyph manifest …/glyphs.sum names no upstream commit` | Its header carries the upstream ref. Restore the file, or re-run `pptxkit glyphs sync --ref <commit>` to write both files together. |
| `glyphs can only be synced from a source checkout` | `pptxkit glyphs sync` rewrites files in the repo; an installed wheel has nowhere to put them. Run it from a clone. |
| `could not fetch the glyph upstream at <ref>` | `sync` needs `git` and a network, and clones ~119MB into a temp directory. The error's context carries git's own stderr. |

`pptxkit glyphs verify` reports the same disagreements without raising — it is what
`bin/setup` runs, and what `pptxkit doctor` reports as `glyphs.bundle`.
