# Glyphs — which name to reach for

A curated index into the vendored glyph set: names grouped by what the slide is about,
each with the moment to use it. Read it when you know what a mark should *mean* and not
what it is called.

It is a shortlist, not the vocabulary. 4,001 Material Symbols ship, so a name this page
never mentions very probably resolves — guess the upstream one, and a miss names the
closest real glyphs.

Names are written exactly as you type them into `icon:`. **Bold** entries are curated
aliases — a name pptxkit maps onto a glyph the set calls something else. Everything else
is the glyph's own name, and the hyphenated spelling of an underscored one works too, so
`rocket-launch` and `rocket_launch` reach the same file. Which glyph each curated name
lands on is [`docs/icons.md`](icons.md#the-names-decks-are-already-written-against).

Placing an `icon:` is [`docs/components.md`](components.md#icon--a-vector-mark); how the
lookup resolves a name is [`docs/icons.md`](icons.md#the-search-order).

## Plain shapes and marks

Geometry rather than meaning — a bullet, a rule's end, a legend swatch.

**Five of these are not glyphs at all.** `circle`, `square`, `triangle`, `diamond` and
`ring` are drawn as DrawingML presets, because for these the geometry *is* the meaning
and an icon set only ever draws its idea of one: Material's square is round-cornered,
and a scan of all 4,001 found no rhombus anywhere. A preset is exact at any size and arrives as a shape a reader can grab a
handle on. A directory you configure still wins — ship your own `circle.svg` and you
get it. See [`icons.md`](icons.md#plain-shapes-are-presets-not-art).
