# QA — automated checks for built decks

The `pptxkit qa` command checks a *built* deck (a `.pptx` plus the build manifest
`bin/run build` writes alongside it) against the automated checks below and writes a
findings report. This is a distinct layer from the "render and eyeball it" QA
described in `docs/pptx-deck-building.md` — that loop is a human looking at
`contact_sheet.png`; this one is a machine reading the manifest and, optionally,
the rendered PDF text. Run both. Neither replaces the other — see "What this
layer cannot catch" below for exactly why.

For AI assistants: [`pptx-deck-building.md`](pptx-deck-building.md) covers the render/QA loop end
to end; this doc is the full reference for the automated `qa` command
specifically.

## Running it

```bash
bin/run build examples/feature-tour.deck.yaml
bin/run qa "out/feature-tour/pptxkit Feature Tour v15.pptx"
```

`qa` takes the path to a built `.pptx`. It looks for `<deck>.manifest.json`
next to it unless `--manifest` names a different file, and reads the theme
path the manifest itself recorded unless `--theme` overrides it. If the
manifest is missing, `qa` fails with a message telling you to build the deck
first — it never guesses or synthesizes one. A deck built by hand outside the
compiler (no manifest) cannot be QA'd; build it with `pptxkit build` or accept
that this layer has nothing to check. The package checks are the exception —
they read the `.pptx` itself, so they stay honest even when the manifest is
stale from a hand-edit.

Every check but two runs off the manifest or the saved file alone and is
effectively instant. `overflow` renders the deck with LibreOffice and extracts text with
Poppler's `pdftotext`; `render-contrast` reads the pixels of that same render. Both cost
it, and `--no-render` skips both when you only want the fast geometry/contrast pass
(e.g. a pre-commit hook).

`--outdir` controls where `qa.md` / `qa.json` land (default `<deck-dir>/render/<deck>`).

## The checks

| Check | Reads | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| `bounds` | manifest only | A shape's declared box extends past the slide edges. |
| `placement-fit` | manifest only | A shape's declared box escapes the rect its own placement was given — an overrun onto the neighbouring placement, which `bounds` passes because the shape is still on the slide. |
| `reserved` | manifest only | A shape's declared box intrudes on one of the theme's `reserve:` regions (e.g. the logo wedge). |
| `min-font` | manifest only | A shape's declared font size is below the theme's minimum. |
| `contrast` | manifest only | A shape's declared foreground/background pair fails WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal text, 3.0:1 at 18pt+). **Severity follows certainty**: a shortfall above 3:1 warns, because the manifest records the pair a component asked for and the real backdrop may be better; below 3:1 nothing behind the text saves it, so it is an error. The build itself never refuses on contrast — it logs `theme_pair_below_aa` and carries on, so a brand's own palette is never unbuildable over a check this layer runs better. |
| `text-fit` | manifest only | A shape whose own recorded text needs more height than the box it declared — text running past its own frame, which `bounds` structurally cannot see. Each line is measured at its own recorded size. |
| `overflow` | manifest + render | A line of text the manifest says a shape contains is missing from the rendered PDF's extracted text for that slide. |
| `render-contrast` | **the render's pixels** | Text on a slide showing a picture — one this deck placed, or one the template paints behind every slide — whose *rendered* surroundings fall below WCAG AA. Measured in three horizontal bands per shape, so a gradient scrim is judged where it is weakest. |
| `chart-negative` | **the .pptx itself** | A bar or column chart carrying a negative value — not a fault in the file, but one the render cannot verify, because LibreOffice plots it as positive. Line and scatter series are unaffected and are not flagged. See [`charts.md`](charts.md#negative-values-and-why-the-render-cannot-check-them). |
| `shape-id` | **the .pptx itself** | Two shapes on a slide sharing an id, or an id outside 1..2147483647. |
| `stale-manifest` | both | The deck's bytes no longer hash to what the manifest recorded — it was edited after the build, so every other finding describes the file that was built rather than the one on disk. WARN. |
| `shape-name` | **the .pptx itself** | Two shapes on a slide sharing a name. Legal OOXML and invisible in a render, but it costs the deck the mapping back to its spec — see [Shape names](#shape-names). WARN. |
| `animation-target` | **the .pptx itself** | An animation naming a shape id the slide does not contain. |
| `relationship` | **the .pptx itself** | An `r:embed`/`r:id` nothing declares, or one pointing at a part the package does not hold. |
| `package` | **the .pptx itself** | The file is not a readable `.pptx`, or a slide part is not well-formed XML. |

The first five read the *manifest*, not the `.pptx` file's actual XML — the manifest
is the compiler's own record of what it meant to place.

**`render-contrast` reads neither.** On a slide whose text sits on a photograph there
is no recorded pair to read — what is behind a title is whatever that picture happens
to be there, blended with whatever scrim went over it — so this one opens the render
and measures the colour actually surrounding each line. It is the only check that can
catch a scrim the build thought was enough and a renderer composited differently, and
it runs only on slides showing a picture — one this deck placed, or the backdrop the
template itself paints, which the manifest records on the slide rather than on any
shape.

**The last four read the saved package**, and they answer a different question: not
"is this slide well designed" but "will PowerPoint open this file at all". PowerPoint
validates the package before it draws anything, and a duplicate shape id, a dangling
relationship or an animation targeting a shape that was never drawn all produce the
same outcome — a repair prompt, and silently discarded content if you accept it.
LibreOffice is far more forgiving, so a render that looks perfect proves nothing here.
Timing is the one tree pptxkit writes as raw XML, which is why its targets are checked
against the shapes actually present.

A shape from a placement the author declared `bleed: true` is exempt from `bounds`:
leaving the canvas is the instruction, and reporting it as an error would mean a
bleed-heavy deck could never produce a clean run. The exemption follows the
*declaration*, recorded in the manifest, not the geometry — a shape that escapes
without saying so is still an error. A full-bleed shape (at the origin and at least
slide-sized) is likewise exempt from `bounds` and `reserved` by design — that is
chrome, not a placement bug — and shapes recorded
with `rendered: "image"` are skipped by `contrast` and `overflow`, because a
rasterized panel is not text the manifest can vouch for.

`bounds` and `reserved` are checked once per distinct shape+box — a
multi-paragraph textbox is one geometry no matter how many paragraphs it
holds, so it is not reported once per line. `min-font` and `contrast` are
checked once per *manifest row* — and a row is not always a paragraph.

The composer records one row per chrome paragraph it draws, so a defect on any
line of a title/subtitle stack is caught. The body components do not: each
records one row per shape naming a deliberately **dominant** size and colour.
`callouts` records the head's 18pt and `title` colour for a row that also
holds 13.5pt body copy; `stats` records the value's size and `accent`
against the tile fill for a row that also holds the label. What a row does
not name is not checked — that body copy is never contrast-checked, and that
label's size is never compared to the theme minimum.

`table` is the exception: it records one row per **cell**, each with that cell's
own box, so every cell is contrast- and size-checked and `bounds`/`reserved`
measure the column rather than the table. A finding names the cell —
`'s3.p2.table.r2c4'` — not the table. A cell that reaches with `across:` or `down:`
records the box it really covers, so the check measures the span and not the
first square of it; the cells it swallowed record nothing, because they are not
there to measure.

Two skips remove rows from these checks entirely, silently: `contrast` skips
any record missing a foreground or background colour, and `min-font` skips
any record whose `font_pt` is `null`. Both are common — the 29-slide feature-tour
deck's manifest carries 129 native text rows, of which 16 have no recorded
size and 13 have no colour pair. **A clean `min-font`/`contrast` run does not
mean every line was measured; it means every line that named a size and a
colour pair was.**

## What the manifest records

### Provenance

The manifest opens with what produced it, before the records it describes:

| Key | What it is |
|---|---|
| `build_id` | Identity of the build: the spec, the theme and the pptxkit version. The same inputs give the same id. |
| `pptxkit` | The version that wrote the file, so an old manifest is recognisable as old. |
| `spec` | The `.deck.yaml` this deck was compiled from. |
| `spec_hash` | That file's contents when it was read. |
| `deck` / `deck_hash` | The `.pptx` written, and its contents. |
| `theme` / `theme_hash` / `theme_path` | The theme, unchanged from before. |
| `canvas` | `{"w", "h", "unit": "in"}` — the slide size, rounded like every other inch. |

Paths are written **relative to the manifest** wherever the two share a directory
tree, so a manifest handed over beside its deck carries no absolute home directory,
and the pair survives being moved. `qa` resolves `theme_path` back against the
manifest's own location.

**The three paths are written relative to the manifest**, so a manifest handed over
beside its deck carries no build-machine path, and a deck directory survives being
moved. `qa` resolves `theme_path` against the manifest's own location; an absolute one
— an older manifest, or a build whose theme shared no ancestor with its output — is
used as written.

`deck_hash` is the one that catches a **hand-edited deck**. Every check below describes
what the build *intended*; open the `.pptx` in PowerPoint, move a box and save, and the
records here still describe the deck as built. `qa` compares the hash on every run and
reports [`stale-manifest`](#the-checks) when they differ — a warning rather than an
error, because hand-editing is the sanctioned way to finish a deck. Once it fires, read
every other finding as history.

### Placements, and the rect a shape belongs inside

Each slide records the placements it drew, before its shapes:

```json
"placements": [
  {"origin": "s1.hero.bullets", "component": "bullets",
   "box": {"x": 0.8, "y": 2.1, "w": 5.767, "h": 4.95}}
]
```

`origin` is the prefix every shape that placement drew carries in its `name`, which is
the only link from a shape back to the rect it was constrained to — `placement-fit`
walks it. `component` is what the placement declared, and the check reads it to exempt
`connector`, which draws *between* two other placements rather than inside its own.

A shape drawn on no placement — chrome, the background — matches no origin and is
simply not measured, so nothing has to list it. A slide that drew no placements at all
records no `placements` key.

`plate` on a shape marks a surface the compiler painted so something else could be read
on it. It is deliberately larger than the text it sits behind, so `placement-fit` skips
it; it is the one overhang the compiler chooses rather than the author.

### Sizes, when a shape sets more than one

`font_pt` is the shape's *dominant* size — the one `min-font` and `contrast` judge it by.
A shape whose paragraphs sit at different rungs also records `line_pt`, one size per
entry in `lines`:

```json
"lines": ["Precedent is not permission", "Existing code tells you what someone did once"],
"font_pt": 18.0,
"line_pt": [18.0, 13.5]
```

Without it a reader has no way to tell a 13.5pt body line from its 18pt heading, and
measuring both at 18 over-reports the shape's height by half. `record()` refuses a
`line_pt` whose length does not match `lines`, so the two cannot drift apart.

### Shape names

Every shape is named for the spec node that drew it, in the manifest **and in the
`.pptx` itself**:

```
s7.p2.card#1          slide 7, second placement, a card — its first shape
s7.hero.card#1        the same placement, where the author gave it `id: hero`
s7.chrome.title       a chrome line with its own `at:` — its own textbox
s7.chrome             the stacked chrome; its lines are paragraphs in one frame,
                      so the manifest holds `s7.chrome.title` and the package cannot
s7.p4.table.r2c3      a table cell, which is not a shape and so is named only here
s7.bg#1               the slide's background
```

PowerPoint preserves shape names through an edit, so the name is what maps a
shape in a hand-edited deck back to the spec that made it — and what the
Selection Pane shows while you are editing.

A placement's number moves when another is inserted above it. Giving it an
[`id:`](authoring.md#placing-components-with-place) fixes its name instead.

### Boxes, rounding, and what is left out

A shape's rectangle is keyed and in inches from the top-left of the slide:

```json
"box": {"x": 0.8, "y": 0.375, "w": 11.733, "h": 1.05}
```

**Inches are rounded to three decimals and point sizes to two.** PowerPoint stores
geometry in EMUs — 914400 to the inch — so dividing back out leaves sixteen digits
of binary residue, and a 13pt line records as `12.99975`. The rounding is an order
of magnitude inside the checks' own tolerances (0.01in at an edge, 0.02in for a
full bleed), so no check can change verdict, and a one-EMU shift no longer rewrites
fourteen digits in a diff.

**A key still at its default is not written.** No `"text": null`, no `"lines": []`,
no `"bleed": false` — about a third of the keys in a deck's manifest. A reader that
wants one falls back to the default on `ShapeRecord`: `rendered` is `"native"`,
`bleed` and `backdrop` are `false`, everything else is `null` or empty.

Read a box with `pptxkit.compile.record.box_of(shape)`, which returns
`(left, top, width, height)` or `None`, and the slide size with `canvas_of(manifest)`.
A manifest written before boxes were keyed raises a `SpecError` naming the rebuild
rather than failing obscurely — a bare `dict` survives `tuple()` and `list()` by
yielding its *key names*, so a silent wrong answer was the alternative.

### Animation steps

A slide's `animations` are one entry per build, each a list of **steps** — one click
each, in order — naming the shapes that arrive:

```json
{"kind": "click_sequence",
 "steps": [["s3.p1.callouts#1", "s3.p1.callouts#2"],
           ["s3.p1.callouts#3", "s3.p1.callouts#4"]]}
```

Names rather than shape ids: an id says nothing to a reader, and is not unique on a
slide — every cell of a table reports its frame's. A shape animated but never
recorded keeps its id as `shape 4`, which at least says which. The motion *role* a
component reported is not recorded; it had already chosen an OOXML preset before the
manifest was written.

### The deck's words

The manifest describes a thousand shapes to say what a few hundred lines of text are —
by line it is about 3.6% content. `pptxkit build` therefore writes
**`<deck>.content.md`** beside it: the same build rendered for a reader, slide by
slide, with the chrome as headings, tables as tables, bullets as bullets, and speaker
notes as quotes. Each block is labelled with the origin that drew it, so a line you
want to change points at the placement to change it in.

It is derived from the manifest and carries the same `build_id` — one writer, two
renderings, so they cannot disagree. Regenerate it; never edit it.

## Severity and `--fail-on`

`bounds`, `placement-fit`, `reserved`, and `overflow` (plus the `page-count`
fallback overflow emits when the manifest's slide count doesn't match the render's
page count) are `error`, and so is every package check — `shape-id`, `animation-target`,
`relationship` and `package` — since a file PowerPoint will not open is not a
matter of degree. `min-font`, `contrast`, `render-contrast` and `canvas-size`
are `warn`. Findings are data, not exceptions — a deck with findings still
builds and `qa` still exits 0 unless you pass `--fail-on`:

```bash
bin/run qa "out/feature-tour/pptxkit Feature Tour v15.pptx" --fail-on error
```

exits non-zero only if the worst finding meets or exceeds the named severity
(`error` / `warn` / `info`). Without `--fail-on`, `qa` always exits 0 regardless
of what it found — it is a report, not a gate, until you opt into one.

A manifest with no `slides` — an empty list, or the key missing entirely —
adds one more finding: `empty-manifest`, `warn` severity, slide `0`. Without
it, a manifest with nothing to check would silently report zero findings, the
same as a deck that was checked and found clean; this finding is what tells
those two apart.

A manifest whose recorded canvas is not a positive width and height adds
`canvas-size`, `warn`, slide `0`, for the same reason: a render's pixels can
only be mapped to slide coordinates through that canvas, so `render-contrast`
measures nothing at all — and a check that measured nothing must not read the
same as a check that found nothing.

## Reading `qa.md` and `qa.json`

`qa.md` opens with a one-line severity tally, then one `## Slide N` section per
slide that has findings, each finding one bullet with a severity icon
(`✗` error, `!` warn, `·` info), the check name, and its detail string. Slides
with no findings are omitted entirely — an empty section would just be noise.
Findings are sorted slide-ascending, worst-severity-first within a slide.

`qa.json` carries the same findings as a flat list — `slide`, `check`,
`severity`, `detail`, `box` (the shape's declared rectangle as
`{"x", "y", "w", "h"}` in inches, or `null`), `shape` (the shape's name, or
`null`) — plus a `counts` object, for a script to gate on without re-parsing
markdown.

## Env knobs

Read at call time, so a long-lived process
picks up `.env` changes between calls:

| Var | Default | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `PPTXKIT_PDFTOTEXT` | `pdftotext` | The Poppler binary the `overflow` check shells out to. |
| `PPTXKIT_PDFTOTEXT_TIMEOUT_S` | `60` | Seconds before that call is killed. |
| `PPTXKIT_SOFFICE` | `soffice` | The LibreOffice binary `qa` uses to render (unless `--no-render`). |
| `PPTXKIT_PDFTOPPM` | `pdftoppm` | The Poppler binary that rasterizes that render's PDF. |
| `PPTXKIT_RENDER_DPI` | `110` | Rasterization DPI for that render. |

## What this layer cannot catch

Read this section before trusting a clean `qa` run. A reader who over-trusts
this layer is worse off than one who knows its edges — treat every check here
as a strong signal on a narrow slice of "is this deck okay," not a guarantee.

- **A shape's declared box is not its rendered text extent.** `bounds` checks
  the box the manifest recorded for a shape — it has no way to know whether
  the text *inside* that box overflows the box's own edges. This is exactly
  how a real bug shipped earlier in this project: a bulleted list rendered a
  foot off the bottom of the slide while every geometry check reported clean,
  because the shape's declared frame was on-slide even though its rendered
  text was not. If a component can grow taller than its declared box (long
  bullet lists, unbounded user content), that risk lives entirely outside what
  `bounds` can see.
- **A shape can still overlap a neighbour without leaving its own rect.**
  `placement-fit` closes the case where a component draws past the rectangle it
  was handed. It does not close the case where the box is legal and the ink is
  not. A `box:` placement is exact geometry and is never narrowed, so two boxes
  the author wrote may legitimately overlap, and a `plate` is exempt by
  declaration. Rotation and effects are absent from the manifest by construction —
  `Box.from_emu` reads the shape's transform and nothing else — so shadows, a
  centred outline straddling its own edge, `fanout`'s rotated arrowhead and
  PowerPoint's own table auto-grow are rendered ink that no box check can see.
  The render remains the only thing that catches those, by eye.
- **Text inside a rasterized panel is invisible to `pdftotext`.** Anything
  recorded as `rendered: "image"` (HTML-card screenshots, doc/code panels) is
  skipped by `contrast` and `overflow` on purpose — checking it would report
  false losses for text a PDF extractor structurally cannot read. That also
  means those panels get *zero* automated coverage: overflow, illegible type,
  and low contrast inside a screenshotted card are only caught by eye. This
  exclusion is by design, not a gap to close — see `docs/panels.md` for the
  full panel pipeline and the costs of choosing a panel over a native shape.
- **`text-fit` sees only what a component records.** A shape whose paragraphs sit at
  different rungs records a `line_pt` — one size per line — and each is measured at its
  own. A multi-line record *without* those sizes is skipped rather than guessed at,
  because measuring a body paragraph at its heading's size over-reports by a wide margin
  and would fill a sound deck with invented findings. So a component that records a
  heading and its copy under one `font_pt` is invisible to this check until it records
  the sizes too.
- **Every width this layer measures is only as good as the face's metrics.**
  `text-fit`, and the height arithmetic every component uses to size its own
  boxes, are computed from per-character advances — and pptxkit ships those for
  two families only, Calibri/Carlito and Arial/Helvetica/Liberation. A theme
  naming anything else is laid out against a deliberately loose ceiling, so a
  clean `text-fit` on such a deck means "nothing overflowed the widest estimate
  available," not "the text fits." The build says so at the time:
  `warning theme_face_unmeasured` names the face and the role. Read that warning
  before trusting this section. It compounds when the face is also **not
  installed** where the deck is opened — the build reserves ceiling width, the
  renderer substitutes something narrower, and a slide that overlaps for your
  audience reports clean for you. See
  [`theme.md`](theme.md#the-face-and-whether-pptxkit-can-measure-it) for the
  table of measured families and what to do about it.
- **`min-font` and `contrast` see rows, not lines.** A manifest row can stand
  for a whole multi-paragraph shape under one dominant size and colour, and a
  row that names no size (or no colour pair) is skipped without a finding —
  see "The checks" above for which components record which. Text can
  therefore be too small, or below AA, on a deck these two report clean.
- **`contrast` trusts the manifest's recorded colours, not a sampled pixel.**
  If a component records the wrong foreground or background role — e.g. the
  page background role instead of the dark image actually behind a shape —
  the check computes a ratio for colours that were never really adjacent on
  the slide. It is exactly as accurate as the compiler's own bookkeeping.
  `render-contrast` is the answer to that on a slide carrying a picture, and
  only there — everywhere else the manifest's colours are all anything reads,
  and `--no-render` removes even that.
- **The render is LibreOffice, not PowerPoint.** Font substitution and text
  metrics differ between the two, so `overflow`'s judgment of what did or
  didn't survive rendering is a strong signal, not a guarantee — a line that
  fits in LibreOffice's font substitute could still clip in real PowerPoint,
  and vice versa. Animation states are also irrelevant here: LibreOffice
  renders the final built state, so a `qa` render cannot see a click-reveal
  that never gets to that state. A **slide transition** is invisible to this
  layer twice over: it produces identical renders, and it touches nothing in the
  manifest, so no check reads it at all. Schema validity and child order for both
  are covered by `tests/test_ooxml_schema.py`, not by `qa` — see
  [`motion.md`](motion.md#verification). It cuts the other way too: LibreOffice's
  importer has its own faults, so a render finding can mean the deck is fine
  and the renderer is not. A `table` row that is entirely a vertical merge is
  legal OOXML which LibreOffice mis-imports, dropping the table's last row and
  moving the whole table — `inspect` and the manifest both read correct.
  Isolate before believing either side: build the shape with one variable
  changed and render both.
- **A structural readback is not a render.** `tests/test_templates.py` builds every
  exercise against every real template and reads the result back out of the
  file, which is a strong check on what the compiler *wrote* and no check at
  all on what a renderer *does with it*. The vertical-merge fault above passed
  the corpus against all eleven templates and was caught only by rendering a
  built deck. A capability is not proven until something has looked at it.
- **`overflow` is a normalized substring search, not a layout check.** It
  proves a line of text landed *somewhere* on the rendered page — not that it
  landed inside its own shape, not that it isn't overlapping another shape,
  and not that it wasn't shrunk to the edge of legibility to fit. Matching
  ignores case, spacing, and hyphens — `pdftotext` rebuilds a line the
  renderer wrapped at a hyphen as either `nontext` (reading order deletes the
  hyphen) or `non- text` (`-layout` keeps it at the row break), and neither
  is loss — but that same leniency means a garbled or reordered rendering of
  the right characters would not be flagged either.
- **A wrapped line in a multi-column block reports a false `overflow`.** Both
  extractions read a page row by row, so where two columns sit side by side the
  neighbouring column's text lands *between* the halves of a line the renderer
  wrapped: `…the router does` / `• Write-offs stop…` / `not`. The line is never
  contiguous in either pass, so the search misses it and the check reports text
  it can plainly see. A two-column `bullets:` whose longest item wraps is the
  usual way to meet it. The finding is `[error]`, and on this one shape it is
  worth confirming against the render before believing it.
- **None of these checks are a design review.** Visual hierarchy,
  alignment, spacing balance, and "does this look intentional" are out of
  scope entirely — the vision-model design review carried into Plan C2 is
  aimed at that gap, not this one.

## Adding a new check

A manifest-only check is a function `(manifest: dict, theme: Theme) -> list[Finding]`
in `src/pptxkit/qa/geometry.py`. That `dict` is the serialised form of `ShapeRecord`,
`PlacementRecord` and `SlideRecord` in `src/pptxkit/compile/record.py` — read those
dataclasses for the keys and their units rather than inferring them from a built deck's
JSON. `manifest.py` only writes them. One that
needs the render goes in
`src/pptxkit/qa/textflow.py` (extracted text) or `src/pptxkit/qa/imagery.py`
(pixels, taking the rendered images rather than the theme); one that reads the saved
package goes in `src/pptxkit/qa/package.py`, taking the deck path alone. Wire it into
`run_qa` (`src/pptxkit/qa/runner.py`) — inside the `if render:` block if it needs one —
and give every `Finding` a `severity` that matches the table above: `error` for a
placement/content defect the audience will notice, `warn` for a quality issue worth a
human decision. Add its row to "The checks" table and, if it has a blind spot, a
bullet in "What this layer cannot catch."
