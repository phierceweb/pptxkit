# Utils — the shared primitives, and why none of them is a pf-core call

What lives in `src/pptxkit/utils/`: colour maths, string measurement, the fraction
vocabulary, polygon geometry, and the python-pptx primitives every component draws
with. This doc covers what each module is for, the constraints that keep it callable
from every layer above it, and the pf-core check each one has already been through.

These are library internals with no project content in them. Nothing here reads a deck
spec, a theme or a `SlideCtx` — a helper that needs one of those belongs in the
subsystem that owns it. `utils/spans.py` is the near-exception, and the section on it
says exactly how far it goes.

Before adding anything here, check whether pf-core already has it — that is a rule
with teeth, and `bin/check-framework` is what enforces it.

## The tier utils sits in

`bin/check-layers` ranks `utils` at L2, beside `motion` and `services`. It may import
the standard library, python-pptx, and the L1 modules — `src/pptxkit/errors.py`,
`config.py`, `paths.py`. It may not import `theme`, `spec`, `layouts`, `components`,
`charts`, `qa` or anything above them, and the refusal is exercised rather than assumed:
`tests/test_layer_gate.py` writes `import pptxkit.components` into a copy of
`utils/deck.py` and asserts the gate exits 1 naming it.

That rank is the whole admission test. **A helper that needs the theme, the grid or a
slide context is not a util** — it is a method on the context or a function in the
subsystem holding that state. What survives the constraint is arithmetic and python-pptx
mechanics, which is exactly what is here.

Two consequences, both easy to break by habit:

- **No module here logs.** These are pure functions; they raise, and the caller with the
  context decides whether that is worth a log line.
- **No module here reads the environment or writes a file.** A tunable belongs in the
  subsystem that owns it; a helper that ever
  needs to write one calls `pf_core.utils.io.atomic_write_text` / `_json` / `_bytes`
  rather than reinventing the rename dance.

## `color.py` — the WCAG maths

`relative_luminance`, `contrast_ratio`, `required_ratio` and `normalize_hex`, plus the
`AA_NORMAL` / `AA_LARGE` / `LARGE_PT` constants. `theme/palette.py`, every component that
picks ink against a fill, `imagery/scrim.py`'s auto-opacity solve and `qa/geometry.py`'s
contrast check all decide against this one implementation, so a slide that passes at
build time and a `pptxkit qa` finding cannot disagree about what 4.5:1 means.

The constants stay in code and out of both the theme and the environment. WCAG's
thresholds are the standard the QA check claims to implement, not an operational knob —
a deck that could lower `AA_NORMAL` in its theme would be reporting on a bar it moved
itself. `LARGE_PT` is 18.0 and WCAG's separate 14pt-bold allowance is deliberately not
honoured: components and QA both size bold text against the normal ratio.

`normalize_hex` raises `ThemeError` for anything that is not six hex digits. It takes no
`error:` parameter: every caller is holding a colour that came from a palette or a
template's colour scheme, so one class is right for all of them.

**Never assert a colour property using `contrast_ratio` to compute the expectation** —
`docs/testing.md` uses exactly that as its canonical circular test.
`tests/utils/test_color.py` pins the sRGB channel weights with literals (0.2126, 0.7152,
0.0722) for the same reason: a flat channel average also maps white to 1.0 and black to
0.0, so testing only the extremes cannot tell a correct implementation from a wrong one.

## `text.py` and `_metrics.py` — measuring a string

`text_em(text, face)` returns a width in ems; `wrapped_lines(text, width_in=, size_pt=,
face=)` returns how many lines it takes in a box. `LINE_HEIGHT` (1.2) is the line advance
those lines are multiplied by. Chrome band heights (`layouts/chrome.py`), card and table
geometry (`components/_tablegeom.py`, `components/card.py`), category-label room in
`charts/native.py` and QA's own geometry check all size off this pair, so a change here
moves the whole build at once.

`_metrics.py` holds per-character advance tables baked as literals from real font files:
`CALIBRI` (Carlito), `ARIAL` (LiberationSans), and `CEILING`, the per-character max
across every measured face. **No font file ships and none is read at runtime** — that is
the point of baking them. Each family table is itself a max over its Regular and Bold
cuts, so no caller passes a bold flag, and `table_for` routes a heavy or black cut to
`CEILING` rather than its family, those being wider than the Bold folded in.
`theme/load.py` warns `theme_face_unmeasured` when a theme's face has no table of its
own: the ceiling fallback is safe but loose, and nothing downstream can see the
looseness.

Three traps for anyone editing this pair:

- **`measured()` compares tables by identity** (`table_for(face) is not CEILING`). Return
  a copy from `table_for` and it silently reports every face as measured. `table_for` is
  `lru_cache`d and returns the module-level dicts; keep it that way.
- **`_MARGIN` in `utils/text.py` errs long by design.** It covers what
  per-character summation cannot see — kerning, hinting, a renderer's own spacing.
  Lowering it is not tuning: a band sized one line short of its text draws straight
  through what sits below it, and neither QA's `bounds` check nor its `overflow` check
  can see a doubled-up chrome stack.
- **`advance_em` over-counts every character no table carries**, charging it the widest
  measured glyph of its class, so a CJK or accented run is never under-counted.

`tests/utils/test_metrics.py` is both the gate and the generator. Run as a script
(`bin/py tests/utils/test_metrics.py`) it prints freshly measured dict literals
to paste in; run as a test it re-measures every baked value against the fonts it came
from, and separately holds `text_em` to never under-predict the real rendered width of
the heaviest cut of each routed family. Both halves skip when the measuring fonts are
absent, like the corpus.

`closest_match(name, options)` shares the module but nothing else: it is the "did you
mean…" behind spec validation errors, a thin wrapper over `difflib.get_close_matches`
with a fixed cutoff.

## `spans.py` — names, never inches

The named fractions a placement can use (`COL_SPANS`, `ROW_SPANS`), the `Share` record a
`split:` child carries, and the parsers `parse_span`, `parse_box` and `percent`.

It lives in utils because it has two readers on the same tier: `spec/_place.py` rejects
an unknown name while parsing, and `layouts/place.py` resolves a known one against the
theme's grid. Either home would make the other import sideways for two tables of eight
strings.

**It knows names, never inches.** `divides(name, divisor, key=)` and
`resolve(name, divisor, key=)` answer in indices against a divisor the caller supplies;
the grid, the canvas and the content band all stay in `layouts/place.py`. What those
indices then become is [`placement.md`](placement.md); what an author writes is
[`authoring.md`](authoring.md).

Two design points to preserve when adding a name or a parser:

- **The parsers take the caller's error class.** The same malformed `at:` is a
  `SpecError` from a slide and a `LayoutError` from a chrome field, and utils cannot know
  which — so it raises the class it is handed. Follow that whenever a helper's failure
  means different things to different callers.
- **`spans_for` raises on an unknown axis key** rather than defaulting to one of the two
  vocabularies. A `rows:` error offering the column names reads as though the author
  wrote nonsense, when the code picked the wrong table. It raises a bare `KeyError`, and
  that is deliberate: an axis key that is neither `cols` nor `rows` is a caller's
  mistake, not an author's, so it has no place in an error an author will read.

## `poly.py` — reserved-region geometry

`point_in_poly`, `segments_cross`, `poly_hits_box` and `poly_x_span`, in whatever units
the caller passes. `Reserved` in `layouts/place.py` is the only consumer: it stores a
region as canvas fractions, scales the points to inches, and asks whether a placement's
rect touches the region and how far the region reaches into a horizontal band.

The polygon is the reason this module exists. A brand's reserved corner is usually a
triangular wedge, and a bounding box around it would forbid the usable space above the
diagonal. `poly_x_span` is what lets a placement bounded by `rows:` above the wedge keep
the full content width.

`poly_hits_box` tests vertex containment **both ways and then the edges**, because two
rectangles can cross in a `+` with no vertex of either inside the other. Deleting the
edge pass leaves a gap no build would notice: the failure is a placement quietly allowed
to sit across a logo.

## `shapes.py` and `deck.py` — the python-pptx primitives

`shapes.py` is the drawing floor every native component sits on: `solid`, `para`,
`textbox`, `rrect`, `rect`, `notes`, `bring_to_front`. Positions and sizes are inches,
colours are `RGBColor` — resolution from theme roles happens above, in the component.
`DEFAULT_FONT` is only the fallback for a caller that passes no font; components pass
`ctx.theme.face` or `ctx.theme.font_for(style)` on every call.

Three behaviours in here are not python-pptx defaults and are relied on everywhere:

- `solid()` clears the shadow (`shape.shadow.inherit = False`), which templates ship on
  by default for autoshapes.
- `para()` reuses the frame's first paragraph when `first=True` and that paragraph is
  still empty, so a text frame does not open with a blank line.
- `ALIGN` and `ANCHOR` are both the enum maps and the accepted vocabulary: `ALIGNS` and
  `ANCHORS` are what `spec/_place.py`, `components/_tablespec.py` and `layouts/chrome.py`
  validate against, so adding a key adds it to the wire format at the same instant.

`deck.py` holds the two presentation-level operations python-pptx does not expose.
`open_presentation(path, what=, error=)` exists because python-pptx surfaces a corrupt,
truncated or foreign package as any of `PackageNotFoundError`, `KeyError`, `ValueError`
or `XMLSyntaxError` — four classes sharing no base, which reach the CLI as a traceback
with no path in it. Every reader goes through it: `compile/build.py` and `theme/load.py`
for a template (default `ThemeError`), `qa/inspect.py` and `compile/readback.py` for a
built deck (`error=SpecError`, `what="deck"`). `delete_slide(prs, index)` drops the
slide's `sldIdLst` entry and releases its part relationship; `compile/build.py` calls it
newest-index-first to strip a template's own sample slides, because indices shift under
a forward loop.

Both modules carry deliberately broad `except Exception` clauses, each with a
`noqa: BLE001` and a stated reason — no shared base class, a shape with no adjustment
handle, a relationship already dropped. **Do not read those as licence to widen it.**
Swallowing an exception silently is still forbidden; these are three named
python-pptx surfaces, not a house style.

## `xml.py` — parsing XML somebody else wrote

```python
from pptxkit.utils.xml import fromstring
root = fromstring(archive.read("ppt/slides/slide1.xml"))
```

One function, and every `lxml` parse in the package goes through it. `lxml`'s default
parser expands entities declared in an inline DTD; this one refuses them, refuses
network access, and refuses the huge-tree relaxation.

That matters because a `.pptx` is usually **not ours**: `conform`, `qa`, `inspect` and
`diff` all read a package the user was handed. With expansion on, a file that merely
*declares* pptxkit's own sample marker as an entity is accepted as one of ours, and a
DTD a few lines long expands to whatever size it likes.

`tests/test_xml_safety.py` is the gate, and it has two halves: the behaviour, and a
sweep refusing any direct `etree.fromstring` elsewhere in `src/pptxkit`. Reach for the
helper, not the library.

## What was checked against pf-core

`bin/check-framework`'s own `EXEMPT` table records the deliberate non-adoptions
project-wide. These are the ones specific to this package, so the check does not have to
be redone from memory:

| Helper here | Nearest pf-core | Why it stays |
|---|---|---|
| `color.py` | nothing | pf-core carries no colour module; the maths is the WCAG spec, not a utility choice |
| `text_em`, `wrapped_lines`, `_metrics.py` | nothing | font advances are a PowerPoint-shaped problem the framework has no reason to know about |
| `poly.py` | nothing | four functions of plane geometry; a C-extension dependency would cost more than it saves |
| `shapes.py`, `deck.py` | nothing | pf-core knows nothing about OOXML or python-pptx |
| `xml.py` | `pf_core.parsers` | not a match: that is a stdlib `html.parser` walker rendering article HTML to plain text plus link records. pf-core does not depend on `lxml` at all, and has no XML tree parser to harden |
| `closest_match` | `pf_core.utils.similarity` | different question, and the numbers say so — below |

`pf_core.utils.similarity.is_near_duplicate` is the one that looks like a hit and is not.
It answers "are these two bodies of text near-duplicates" with a boolean, over character
4-shingles at a 0.75 Jaccard threshold. `closest_match` answers "which one of these
short identifiers did the author mean" and must rank a vocabulary and return `None` when
nothing is close enough. Shingling is the wrong instrument at that length: `titel` and
`title` share no 4-gram at all, so Jaccard scores them 0.0 and `is_near_duplicate` says
no, where `difflib.SequenceMatcher` scores 0.8 and the suggestion lands. `difflib` is
also standard library, not the third-party reach the framework-first rule is aimed at.

Nothing here hand-rolls what the framework does provide either: no `logging`, no
`os.environ`, no atomic-write dance, and no builtin `ValueError` or `RuntimeError` where
a `pptxkit.errors` class belongs. `bin/check-framework` enforces all of that and names
the replacement in every failure.

## Adding a helper here

1. **Check pf-core first.** Start at `docs/pf-core/modules.md` (the symlink `bin/setup`
   creates); [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) states the rule. The gate refuses the common cases, but
   it only knows the rules someone wrote down — the index is the actual check.
2. **Check the tier.** If it needs the theme, the grid, a spec document or a slide
   context, it is not a util; put it in the subsystem that owns that state. L2 cannot
   import L3, and `bin/check-layers` runs in pre-commit and CI.
3. **Keep it pure.** Inputs and outputs, no logging, no environment reads, no file
   writes. Take units from the caller rather than assuming inches or fractions —
   `poly.py` is unit-agnostic for exactly this reason.
4. **Raise a `pptxkit.errors` class.** Default it (as `deck.py` does with `ThemeError`)
   when one class is nearly always right; take it as an `error:` parameter (as
   `spans.py` does) when the same failure means different things to different callers.
5. **Test the thing a build cannot see.** A helper's arithmetic is usually exercised by
   the corpus already, and `docs/testing.md` says not to restate that. What needs a
   unit test is what a green build hides: every `raise`, every baked constant nothing
   downstream asserts on, and any measurement whose error direction matters — the wrap
   estimate has a floor test precisely because under-predicting is invisible until a
   render.
6. **Write it up here** and add the row to [`README.md`](README.md) if the module is new.
