# OOXML schemas — ISO/IEC 29500-4:2016

The PresentationML schema and its transitive imports, used by
`tests/test_ooxml_schema.py` to validate the raw XML `pptxkit.motion` writes.

`pptxkit` authors `<p:timing>` and `<p:transition>` as raw strings, because
python-pptx models neither. Nothing else can check that output: LibreOffice
converts schema-invalid timing to PDF without complaint, and a `pptxkit qa`
render sees only the final state of a slide.

Nine files, the closure of `pml.xsd`'s `schemaLocation` imports. They are not
packaged into the wheel, but they do ship in the sdist, which carries a
runnable suite — `tests/test_ooxml_schema.py` fails rather than skips when the
schema is absent, so the notice below travels with them.
