"""What a built distribution is allowed to contain.

`.gitignore` keeps brand material out of the *repo*. It does nothing for a *dist*:
`python -m build` packs the working tree, so a checkout with a populated
`templates/` builds an sdist containing licensed artwork unless MANIFEST.in says
otherwise. These pin that layer, so `pip install git+https://…` and any local build
stay clean.
